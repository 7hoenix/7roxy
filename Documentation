# Proxy

## An open source Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agent

- Incoming / Outgoing data communication channels.
  - Type level (AST) commands
  - Audio
  - Textual
- Reacts to data that is received.

Outer loop:
- Learns to improve over time.

Improvement in this context:
- User can load preferences.

## Domains (modules / interfaces):

### Capabilities

- What actions is Proxy capable of taking.

Hook for when we get to interface with other Agents later.

### Policies

- What responses is Proxy authorized to take for a given scenario.
- Delegation of authority and credentials.

## Usecase examples

### Schedule pairing Agent - Agent
Prerequisites:
-> Permission to see and update calendars.
-> Permission to manage segments of time (granted to human).

--> Default setting is to respond to requests (queries) with suggestions that then require signoff.

Level 2 or 3:
---> User sets priorities (for instance, schedule pairing with Geoff once per month).

IDEA:
---> Potential idea is to allow auto approval of suggestions (for certain policies).

### Scheduling (balance) assistant -- time budget.

Do X amount of work on this goal xs
Do Y amount of work on this goal ys

How you want your schedule to be arranged:
- When for each domain:
  - Physical
  - Mental
  - etc.
- When are you at your best for each of those?
- How much ramp up do you need to chunk into your short term memory to be effective at the work.

Metrics / Improvment measured by:
- A / B .. / N testing of strategies (strategies are permutations of blocks that *could* be effective).
  - Quality of work (as reported by human).
  - Feeling around sustainable pace, enjoyment of work, etc (as reported by human).

### Personal history repository

- Job history --> Prompt for blurb about completed projects as scheduling to populate portions of this.
- Residence history
- Doctors

### Scheduled reports

- Important scheduled events.
  - Reminders of upcoming deadlines.
- Anything important in the world.
  - How many news outlets are carrying the same story?
    - Extract sets of words across different social media bubbles.
    - Display similar framing
    - Display disparate framing
- Progress report on how Agent (and associates) are doing on longer term assignments
  - Graph of actions taken on your behalf in relation to an established policy.
  - Any blockers communicating with other Agents
  - Anything that needs human intervention <- Can't get something scheduled
- Aggregate metrics

## Security

### Authorized Agent key exchange

- Verified identities of other Agents
- Keybase (ish) implementation of socially signed linked accounts.
  - Github to start.

### Operational level security concerns

- This needs to be addressed.
